This project contains a Fritzing component for the crumble microcontroller based on the Fritzing Generic IC from which it
inherits the PCB. The rest has been created by Javier Casado measuring a crumble board with a calliper, this means dimensions
are accurate but not the exact ones.

I've created it to help my students to document their robotics designs based on the crumble microcontroller. 

To add it to your Fritzing editor just import the part on your personal parts container and start using it.
